    "Backend is Motoko (main.mo) with exercise library + workout generation (generateFullBodyWorkout), recovery state gating, and helpers (buildShuffledSectionFromArrayWithLimit, uniqueByName, calculateRecoveryPercentage).",

    "v366 applied variable substitution (quadsRequestedCount, etc.) but legs still missing due to invalid filter syntax (.toLower() method does not exist on Text) and insufficient test-mode recovery offset",
    "Filter bug: buildShuffledSectionFromArray(WithLimit) uses e.primaryMuscleGroup.toLower() which fails silently → returns 0 exercises for legs",
