      "requirement": "In backend/main.mo, replace the invalid filter using e.primaryMuscleGroup.toLower() inside buildShuffledSectionFromArray with the exact provided block using Text.equal and Text.toLowercase, keeping all Debug.print statements and all other logic unchanged.",

      "evidence": [
