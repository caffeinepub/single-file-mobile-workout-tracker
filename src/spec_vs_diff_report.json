  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to backend/main.mo and project_state.json. The BuildRequest requires three backend changes: (REQ-1) fix adjustRecoveryForTestMode to use a fixed past timestamp, (REQ-2) fix calculateRecoveryPercentage elapsed time calculation to use Time.now() - lastTrained, and (REQ-3) add debug logging for section sizes in generateFullBodyWorkout. The diff is truncated and does not show the actual code changes in main.mo, only imports and type definitions. The project_state.json update shows the requirements are now tracked as pending, but provides no evidence of implementation. Without visible code changes to the three required functions, none of the requirements can be confirmed as implemented.",
