  "summary": "The diff modifies backend/main.mo and project_state.json. The diff of backend/main.mo is truncated and does not show the actual change inside buildShuffledSectionFromArray. Without visible evidence of the filter expression being updated from Text.equal(e.primaryMuscleGroup.toLower(), group.toLower()) to Text.equal(Text.toLowercase(e.primaryMuscleGroup), Text.toLowercase(group)), REQ-20 cannot be confirmed as implemented.",
